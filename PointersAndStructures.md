Understand every-word in this [presentation](https://github.com/aymm-io/FOC/raw/master/Lecture%201.pdf).  
// Check this [repo](https://github.com/aymm-io/FOC) later for other slides.  
  
Read [this document](https://github.com/rohinibarla/dev/raw/master/docs/DataStructures.pdf) to understand memory better.  
or [check here](https://www.interviewcake.com/article/c/data-structures-coding-interview) with different language options for sample code.

Use [Python tutor](http://www.pythontutor.com/c.html#mode=edit) to understand C program with visualization of the program execution.  
See some samples [here](https://github.com/rohinibarla/dev/blob/master/explore_strings.md)  
  
My Code School contains well explained about these concepts.  
Some [samples](https://github.com/rohinibarla/dev/blob/master/video_resources.md)  
  
Check your understanding [Strings](https://github.com/rohinibarla/dev/blob/master/papers/programming_paper_01_strings.pdf)  
  
[ThinkOS](http://greenteapress.com/thinkos/thinkos.pdf) gives you a better understanding of what is happening when programs run, and what you can do to make them run better and faster.  
  
This [repo](https://github.com/rohinibarla/dev) is created during making students understand fundametal concepts. See if you can find something useful.
